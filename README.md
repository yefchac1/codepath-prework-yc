# codepath-prework-yc
Codepath Prework Project (Xcode):
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

App Brainstorming:

Instagram:
- Sending posts to other users thorugh Direct Messaging.
- Choosing who can view your content based on privacy settings.

WhatsApp:
- Allowing International Calling (Audio & Video) through Wi-Fi without putting a constraint on the OS.
- Allowing you to customize background images for specific chats.
- Setting up business accounts which limit what users see from contacting you.

Uber Eats:

- Sending requests to get something delivered to your address from a restaurant or store.
- Mapping which restaurants are closer to shorten delivery time and give the user a more realistic estimate.

App Idea:

- One of my main app ideas is to build an app that allows the user to find good picture spots on specific times and parts of towns (for example, the way the sunset hits on Pier 60 at 50 in Tampa, FL), so if someone takes a picture and posts it, it will show the location and time where the picture was taken, sharing a good spot with other users.
