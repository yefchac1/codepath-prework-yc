# codepath-prework-yc
Codepath Prework Project (Xcode):
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

App Brainstorming:

Instagram:
- Sending posts to other users thorugh Direct Messaging.
- Choosing who can view your content based on privacy settings.

WhatsApp:
- Allowing International Calling (Audio & Video) through Wi-Fi without putting a constraint on the OS.
- Allowing you to customize background images for specific chats.
- Setting up business accounts which limit what users see from contacting you.

Uber Eats:

- Sending requests to get something delivered to your address from a restaurant or store.
- Mapping which restaurants are closer to shorten delivery time and give the user a more realistic estimate.

App Idea:

- One of the main app ideas is a place to find good picture spots on towns, if someone takes a picture and posts it, it will show the location where the picture was taken, making it a good picture spot.
